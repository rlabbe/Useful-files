This file tells git what to ignore. You can put an ignore file in each 
git directory: this one is intended to be global for all projects.

It is set to ignore all Visual Studio generated files, subversion files,
and various temp files. 

It should be put in your "home" directory: ~ in linux, and c:\username\Documents
in Windows
