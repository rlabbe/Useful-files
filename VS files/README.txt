autoexp.dat is used by the visual studio debugger to display your classes in
a human readable format. For example, the Sportvision class Vec3 is displayed
as 3 separate float values rather than just an array. This file needs to be placed
in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Packages\Debugger
(or wherever your visual studio is installed) for VS2010.
